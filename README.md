## Jupyter Notebooks For Reproducible Research

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rse-standrewscs/r-binder-template/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

This repository provides an example of publishing a reproducible
R Jupyter notebook. Click on the binder badge above to launch it
on [Binder](https://mybinder.org), where you will be able to rerun
all calculations yourself.

The short example used in the R Jupyter notebook uses the gapminder
dataset and is based on the Software Carpentry lesson "Programming in R"
taught by Leighton Pritchard in St Andrews on 30-31 May 2019:
